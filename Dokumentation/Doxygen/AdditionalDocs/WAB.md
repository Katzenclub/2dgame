# Design Decisions

Still needs to be added for the Documentation that will be printed as PDF (according to lecture on the 12th January):
- How to use: compilation, tutorial on how to use game
- Design Descisions should be Documented (ex. why SFML, why Engine Desing like Engine is Designed, why Perlin Noise, why Render how we Render)
- Rest is up to us
- Should be 10-12 Pages (including Images and Stuff)
