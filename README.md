# Code Guidelines
g_variable = global variable (it is in no class)  
m_variable = member variable (it is in a class)  
l_variable = local variable (it is mostly defined in a class and on the fly)  

x_pvariable = pointer variable

Case: Camelcase

Example:
m_pfirstWordSecondWord = member as a pointer with multiple words

Every class should be encapsulated with
```
namespace gp {
    Class uwu
}
```
